Experimental Program for a Conference Paper Practicing Knowledge Learned in the Empirical Methods for Software Engineering Course.

## Description

## Result
The LLM-based evaluator showed comparable performance to human evaluators. Here are the results:

```cmd
Human Evaluator 1 accuracy rate: 114 / 116 = 0.9828
Human Evaluator 2 accuracy rate: 114 / 116 = 0.9828
Accuracy of LLM: 112 / 116 = 0.9655
```

The accuracy of the LLM is 96.55%, which is high. It only produced two more incorrect cases compared to the humans.
